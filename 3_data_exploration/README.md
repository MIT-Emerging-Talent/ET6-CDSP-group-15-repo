# Data Exploration (Current Research Question)

This folder contains all exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the processed datasets related to the current research question. Each subfolder corresponds to a dataset and contains:

- A Jupyter notebook (`explore_*.ipynb`) for EDA
- A `figures/` directory with generated visualizations and summary CSVs

## Subfolders and Contents

### new/p2p_lending_cleaned/

- EDA for the P2P lending dataset (current workflow)
- Notebook: `explore_p2p_lending_cleaned.ipynb`
- Figures: `figures/`

(Other new research question datasets and their EDA can be added here as the project evolves.)

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant subfolder.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the EDA and generate figures.
3. All outputs are saved in the corresponding `figures/` directory.

For legacy/archival EDA related to the previous research question, see the `old/` folder.

For more details on EDA philosophy and best practices, see `guide.md` in this folder.
