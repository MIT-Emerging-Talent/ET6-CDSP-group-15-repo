# Datasets

This folder contains all datasets used in the project, organized to support
reproducible research and clear data provenance. Datasets are grouped by their
stage in the workflow: raw, processed, and additional/reference data.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `raw_data/` ‚Äî Original, unmodified datasets as downloaded from
  their sources. **Never edit these files.**
- `processed_data/` ‚Äî Cleaned and transformed datasets, ready for analysis or
  modeling. Each is generated by a script or notebook in the data preparation stage.
- `additional_data/` ‚Äî Supplementary or reference datasets, such as historical
  or contextual data, not used directly for modeling but useful for exploration
  or comparison.

## üì¶ Raw Data Overview

Below is a summary of the raw datasets. For detailed documentation (source,
description, relevance, limitations), see [`raw_data/README.md`](raw_data/README.md).

| Filename                        | Purpose/Description                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| BNPL Intention to use.xlsx      | Survey on BNPL adoption, demographics      |
| BNPL.csv                        | Synthetic BNPL user profiles for risk      |
| FRBNY-SCE-Credit-Access-Data.xlsx | US consumer credit access summary        |
| FRBNY-SCE-Credit-Access-complete_microdata.xlsx | US credit access microdata |
| public2024.csv                  | US household finance & well-being survey   |
| afdr_a8.csv                     | USDA ag loan volume data (Table A8)        |
| afdr_charts.csv                 | Ag finance stats for historical context    |
| sce-household-spending-chart-data.xlsx | Household spending chart data       |

For full details on each file, see [`raw_data/README.md`](raw_data/README.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Processed & Additional Data

- **Processed data** in `processed_data/` are generated by cleaning scripts and
  notebooks (see `2_data_preparation/`). These files are used for analysis and modeling.
- **Additional data** in `additional_data/` includes reference or historical
  datasets for context or exploratory analysis.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Never modify or overwrite files in `raw_data/`.** Always save cleaned or
  transformed data to `processed_data/` or `additional_data/`.
- **Document each dataset**: Include source, description, and relevance in this
  README and in subfolder READMEs.
- **Use clear, descriptive filenames** for all processed and additional datasets.
- **Ensure reproducibility**: All processing steps should be documented in
  scripts or notebooks.
