# Milestone 1 Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Waiting until the last minute to begin deliverables.
- Delaying task distribution and leaving responsibilities unclear.
- Letting group coordination happen reactively instead of proactively.

## Continue Doing

- Sharing research resources with each other actively.
- Clearly stating what each member is working on.
- Having open communication about direction and ideas.
- Aligning early on a shared research focus.

## Start Doing

- Distributing tasks at the very beginning of the milestone cycle.
- Creating a shared task tracker so everyone knows their responsibilities.
- Scheduling regular check-ins to stay on track and avoid last-minute rush.
- Assigning clear leads for documentation, research, and code streams.

## Lessons Learned

We learned that good ideas alone aren't enough—timely execution matters too.
The biggest issue we faced was starting too late. This caused unnecessary
stress, especially during the project design phase, and reduced the quality of
our collaboration. We’ve agreed to change this by planning earlier, assigning
tasks upfront, and being more time-conscious as a team.

## Strategy vs. Reality

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We successfully chose a strong, researchable question rooted in our
  interests and domain strengths.
- Our collaborative research—especially source sharing—worked well.
- The systems thinking framework helped us map the broader connections in our
  problem domain.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We did not start early enough or assign work in a timely manner.
- Our documentation lagged behind and needed late-stage catch-up.
- Internal communication was inconsistent until the final days.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes. We added a last-minute effort to reorganize folders and files for
  clarity.
- We also created a detailed guide and added metadata to explain our domain
  study structure.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Some brainstorming threads were dropped as we narrowed our focus and
  finalized the main research question.

## Individual Retrospectives

**Name:**

**Madiha Malik**  
> I learned how important early planning and role clarity is in group research.
> We had a strong process and alignment, but since we didn’t begin task
> execution early enough, we faced time pressure at the end. For future
> milestones, I’ll make sure we distribute work earlier, communicate clearly,
> and review our timeline often to avoid the same issues.
