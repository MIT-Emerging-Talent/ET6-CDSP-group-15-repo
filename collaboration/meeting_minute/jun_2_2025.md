# 6/2/2025-Meeting

The team discussed the importance of having multiple reviewers
for project merges to minimize errors, suggesting that at least
four reviewers be involved in each merge. We also brainstormed
potential project questions, focusing on the effectiveness of
machine learning in algorithmic trading compared to traditional
models. I proposed a question about the accuracy of machine
learning in trading strategies, while Dadi suggested narrowing
the focus to address specific financial problems. We agreed
to finalize our question after the upcoming study session,
which will be held on Thursday.

Our learning goals were also clarified: individually, we aim to
strengthen our teamwork and data collection skills, while as a
team, we want to understand the impact of AI on traditional trading models.
